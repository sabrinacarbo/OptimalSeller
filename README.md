Optimal Seller

With this app, potential Etsy sellers can look up the item that they are potentially selling, and comparing them to other listings, see the best price that they can offer, and the categories that would best help them list it.

Getting Started
On the opening screen, click "Start Searching!" in the upper right corner, and type a few terms to describe your item, and click the generate button.

Prerequisites
Requires a fairly current browser.

Give examples
A user wants to find out the best way that they can sell their wrought iron horse statue that's named Horsy.

After pressing the "Start Searching" button, "iron horse" is entered into the search box.

Amoungst the categories that come up are clothing, jewelry, books, and others that simply wouldn't apply to Horsy.  The more accurate categories, "Home Decor," "Vintage", "Collectibles" and others are selected.

The app then focuses on the resulting items that are iron horses, and in those categories.

Examples of other sellers' are shown.  A price is recommended, along with a bell curve chart to show you the prices of those items, as well as the tags that they have used, giving the seller a list of potential tags that they should use in their listing.

Built With
