# ProjectOne - Optimal Seller

This app was created to assist not only individuals who have experience with selling product, but who are also new to selling. The app takes a keyword and categories the user inputs and provides a response showing the ideal price, best category or categories, the top 10-15 words they should use in their title, and actual examples of currently listed items. With this information, the seller can then make a listing aimed to target the customer through keywords and pricing. 

Getting Started:

Travel to the deployment site https://sabrinacarbo.github.io/ProjectOne/. Once here, select the "Start Searching!" option located in the upper right corner. This will bring you to a new page where you can type in a keyword or multiple keywords describing your item and then select the Generate button.

Prerequisites:

This app will run in all modern day browsers.

Give examples:

1. A user wants to find out the best way that they can sell their wrought iron horse statue that's named Horsy.

2. After pressing the "Start Searching" button, the user then enters "iron horse" into the search box.

3. Using the search word/s from the search box,  categories that include items with the keyword/s show up. For example, we get clothing, jewelry, books, and others that simply wouldn't apply to Horsy.  The user then has the option to either choose a corresponding category or categories, or leave this section blank. 

4. The app then focuses on the resulting items that are iron horses, and in those categories.

5. Examples of other sellers' are shown.  A price is recommended, along with a bell curve chart to show you the prices of those items, as well as the tags that they have used, giving the seller a list of potential tags that they should use in their listing.

Built With:

Materialize - The web framework used
wordcloud2.js - For the word cloud
plotly - For the bell curve of the prices
